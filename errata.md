# Errata
With every printing effort there are invariably some misprints, these are mine. I'd like to thank the readers who take the time to spot these and point them out. if you find any misprints you can submit them to me here. 
If we decide to do a reprint in the future, we will be using these to make corrections and improvements to the text, so feedback is appreciated!
